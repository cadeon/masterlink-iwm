This is the MasterLink Intelligent Work Management (IWM) system, licensed under GPL V3.0 (see included LICENSE file).

IWM is a work management / asset management system, which makes best use of a workforce by optimally assigning work to workers. IWM was developed for facilities maintenance and manufacturing applications in mind, but can be applied to a wide variety of problems. 

Basically, if you have people performing discrete jobs (such as individual preventative maintenance tasks, or repair jobs - not roles, like retail clerk) IWM may be able to assign your workers faster and more efficiently than human schedulers.

IWM has been run in production with Oracle 11g and JBoss AS 5, however it may run on other configurations also.
